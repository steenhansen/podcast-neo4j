Have short text on first help screen, then really long text on second one node help.
So on second filter help have long explanation about filter
-show only matching authors and stories 
- if you enter 'ze' for a filter then you see aurhors and stories that contain 'ze'

Have widget in div with borders and explain text
- search and view sffaudio's online media content by author and/or story


[-] graph Zoom in , which can also be done with mouse scroll wheel.

So... Filter help

/Book=help-filter& author=help-graph
/Book=help-pdf&.......


On init help screen
"Click on icons for more detailed help"

Every graph gets a small help icon


On help also have a graph icon to say what is the point of the whole thing. Copy of post icon

Have routine hideTooltips, showTooltips instead of get element by id

my.str_val
my_props.str_vsl
my_,props.myFunc()

Better my_popup.my_str
My_history.my_int

D:\github\podcast_neo4j_conf\podcast-neo4j\sff-network\html-pages\widget-vars-html.js


we need to make an icon that looks like

[Filter authors and stories ]
[-]
[+]

talk about mouse scroll
